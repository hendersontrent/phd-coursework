The work of Renner et al. (2018)^[Renner F, Kersbergen I, Field M, Werthmann J. Dutch courage? Effects of acute alcohol consumption on self-ratings and observer ratings of foreign language skills. J Psychopharmacol. 2018 Jan;32(1):116-122. doi: 10.1177/0269881117735687. Epub 2017 Oct 18. PMID: 29043911.] sought to investigate the effects of acute alcohol consumption on self-ratings and the ratings of observers on foreign language skills. The study used a sample of fifty native German speakers who had recently learned Dutch who were randomised into one of two conditions using experimental manipulation: (i) low dose of alcohol; or (ii) control beverage with no alcohol. Post-randomisation, the participants then engaged in a standardised conversation in Dutch with an experimenter blinded to condition. The audio recording of the conversation was then rated by two native Dutch speakers who were also blind to the experimental condition. Each participant also rated their own Dutch skills post-discussion. This essay is divided into two broad sections: (i) commentary on methods reproducibility (i.e., transparency); and (ii) commentary on other forms of reproducibility.

In addition to the methods reproducibility points noted above, there are other aspects of reproducibility worth discussing. Importantly, the article did not provide open access to the data nor code used for analysis. This limits the ability for other researchers to engage in computational reproducibility of the results and raises questions about the transparency of the study. Moreover, However, despite this criticism, there were elements of reproducibility that this article excelled at. The study blinded participants to the experimental condition (low dose of alcohol or control beverage with no alcohol) they were assigned to, and both the experimenter who conducted the study with them and the two native Dutch speakers who conducted observer ratings were also condition-blind. Blinding is critical to this study for several reasons: (i) blinding of participants mitigates *the placebo effect*, whereby un-blinded participants' expectations affect what they perceive and report (essential when self-ratings are a method of measurement, as they are here); (ii) blinding of the experimenter (confederate) who runs the experiment with participants is crucial because knowledge of the manipulation condition may (consciously or unconsciously) make them react differently to participants based on condition (e.g., encourage participants that their Dutch skills are strong, resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy), thus introducing a source of bias; and (iii) blinding of observers is important because knowledge of the manipulation condition may influence their perceptions and introduce bias in their scoring. The study also does not appear to have engaged in hypothesising-after-results-are-known (HARKing). The authors specify a discrete set of four hypotheses (pp. 117), each grounded in previous research and sensible real-world beliefs (such as Hypothesis 1 which posited that those who consumed alcohol would rate their performance higher). Further, not all the results for the hypotheses returned statistically significant results. The lack of exceedingly favourable results makes it unlikely that the authors engaged in HARKing or even *p*-hacking more broadly.

In summary, the Renner et al. (2018) paper asked an interesting research question and devised an appropriate methodology. The perceived reliability of the study could be improved if several aspects of reproducibility if the data and code were made open access. Indeed, follow-up studies from other authors have made these improvements, by both making the code openly accessible and improving the statistical methods from a collection of effect size analyses to a generalised additive mixed effects model which enables more flexible model parameterisation^[Offrede TF, Jacobi J, Rebernik T, de Jong L, Keulen S, Veenstra P, Noiray A, Wieling M. The Impact of Alcohol on L1 versus L2. Lang Speech. 2021 Sep;64(3):681-692. doi: 10.1177/0023830920953169. Epub 2020 Aug 28. PMID: 32856992; PMCID: PMC8406376.]. However, the Renner et al. (2018) study did provide extensive descriptions of experimental methods and measurement tools for self and observer ratings, meaning studies concerned with empirical reproducibility of the findings could feasibly conduct the appropriate work.
