The work of Renner et al (2018)^[Renner F, Kersbergen I, Field M, Werthmann J. Dutch courage? Effects of acute alcohol consumption on self-ratings and observer ratings of foreign language skills. J Psychopharmacol. 2018 Jan;32(1):116-122. doi: 10.1177/0269881117735687. Epub 2017 Oct 18. PMID: 29043911.] sought to investigate the effects of acute alcohol consumption on self-ratings and the ratings of observers on foreign language skills. The study used a sample of fifty native German speakers who had recently learned Dutch who were randomised into one of two conditions using experimental manipulation: (i) low dose of alcohol; or (ii) control beverage with no alcohol. Post-randomisation, the participants then engaged in a standardised conversation in Dutch with an experimenter blinded to condition. The audio reocrding of the conversation was then rated by two native Dutch speakers who were also blind to the experimental condition. Each participant also rated their own Dutch skills post-discussion. This essay is divided into two broad sections: (i) commentary on methods reproducibility (i.e., transparency); and (ii) commentary on other forms of reproducibility.

In addition to the methods reproducibility points noted above, there are other aspects of reproducibility worth discussing. Importantly, the article did not provide open access to the data nor code used for analysis. This limits the ability for other researchers to engage in computational reproducibility of the results and raises questions about the transparency of the study. Moreover, XXXX. However, despite the criticisms described above, there were elements of reproducibility that this article excelled at. The study blinded participants to the experimental condition (low dose of alcohol or control beverage with no alcohol) they were assigned to, and both the experimenter who conducted the study with them and the two native Dutch speakers who conducted observer ratings were also condition-blind. Blinding is critical to this study for several reasons: (i) blinding of participants mitigates *the placebo effect*, whereby un-blinded participants' expectations affect what they perceive and report (essential when self-ratings are a method of measurement, as they are here); (ii) blinding of the experimenter (confederate) who runs the experiment with participants is crucial because knowledge of the manipulation condition may (consciously or unconsciously) make them react differently to participants based on condition, thus introducing a confound; and (iii) blinding of observers is important because knowledge of the manipulation condition may influence their perceptions and introduce a measurement confound in their scoring.
